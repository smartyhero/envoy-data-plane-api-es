 * In Delta XDS there are per-resource versions, which allow tracking state at

 *
 * In Delta xDS the nonce field is required and used to pair
 * ``DeltaDiscoveryResponse`` to a ``DeltaDiscoveryRequest`` ACK or NACK.
 * Optionally, a response message level ``system_version_info`` is present for
 * debugging purposes only.
 *
 * ``DeltaDiscoveryRequest`` plays two independent roles. Any ``DeltaDiscoveryRequest``
 * can be either or both of:
 *
 * * Informing the server of what resources the client has gained/lost interest in
 *   (using ``resource_names_subscribe`` and ``resource_names_unsubscribe``), or
 * * (N)ACKing an earlier resource update from the server (using ``response_nonce``,
 *   with presence of ``error_detail`` making it a NACK).
 *
 * Additionally, the first message (for a given ``type_url``) of a reconnected gRPC stream
 * has a third role: informing the server of the resources (and their versions)
 * that the client already possesses, using the ``initial_resource_versions`` field.
 *
 * As with state-of-the-world, when multiple resource types are multiplexed (ADS),
 * all requests/acknowledgments/updates are logically walled off by ``type_url``:
 * a Cluster ACK exists in a completely separate world from a prior Route NACK.
 * In particular, ``initial_resource_versions`` being sent at the "start" of every
 * gRPC stream actually entails a message for each ``type_url``, each with its own
