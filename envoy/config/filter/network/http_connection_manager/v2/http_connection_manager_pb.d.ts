   *
   * This idle timeout applies to new streams and is overridable by the

   * is terminated with a 408 Request Timeout error code if no upstream response
   * header has been received, otherwise a stream reset occurs.
   *
   * This timeout also specifies the amount of time that Envoy will wait for the peer to open enough
   * window to write any remaining stream data once the entirety of stream data (local end stream is
   * true) has been buffered pending available window. In other words, this timeout defends against
   * a peer that does not release enough window to completely write the stream, even though all

   * <envoy_api_field_core.HttpProtocolOptions.max_stream_duration>` does not apply to this corner
   * case.
   *
   * Note that it is possible to idle timeout even if the wire traffic for a stream is non-idle, due
   * to the granularity of events presented to the connection manager. For example, while receiving
   * very large request headers, it may be the case that there is traffic regularly arriving on the

   * from the downstream connection) prior to Envoy closing the socket associated with that
