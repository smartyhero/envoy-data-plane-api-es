   * By default, one random upstream connection will be selected from the upstream connection pool
   * and used for every request. And after the request is finished, the upstream connection will be
   * released back to the upstream connection pool.
   *
   * If this option is true, the upstream connection will be bound to the downstream connection and
   * have same lifetime as the downstream connection. The same upstream connection will be used for
   * all requests from the same downstream connection.
   *
   * And if this options is true, one of the following requirements must be met:
   *
   * 1. The request must be handled one by one. That is, the next request can not be sent to the
   *    upstream until the previous request is finished.
   * 2. Unique request id must be provided for each request and response. The request id must be
   *    unique for each request and response pair in same connection pair. And the request id must
   *    be the same for the corresponding request and response.
   *
   * This could be useful for some protocols that require the same upstream connection to be used
   * for all requests from the same downstream connection. For example, the protocol using stateful
   * connection.
