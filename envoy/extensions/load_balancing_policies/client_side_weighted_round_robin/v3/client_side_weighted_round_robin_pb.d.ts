/**
 * Configuration for the client_side_weighted_round_robin LB policy.
 *
 * This policy differs from the built-in ROUND_ROBIN policy in terms of
 * how the endpoint weights are determined. In the ROUND_ROBIN policy,
 * the endpoint weights are sent by the control plane via EDS. However,
 * in this policy, the endpoint weights are instead determined via qps (queries
 * per second), eps (errors per second), and utilization metrics sent by the
 * endpoint using the Open Request Cost Aggregation (ORCA) protocol. Utilization
 * is determined by using the ORCA application_utilization field, if set, or
 * else falling back to the cpu_utilization field. All queries count toward qps,
 * regardless of result. Only failed queries count toward eps. A config
 * parameter error_utilization_penalty controls the penalty to adjust endpoint
 * weights using eps and qps. The weight of a given endpoint is computed as:
 * ``qps / (utilization + eps/qps * error_utilization_penalty)``.
 *
 * Note that Envoy will forward the ORCA response headers/trailers from the upstream
 * cluster to the downstream client. This means that if the downstream client is also
 * configured to use ``client_side_weighted_round_robin`` it will load balance against
 * Envoy based on upstream weights. This can happen when Envoy is used as a reverse proxy.
 * To avoid this issue you can configure the :ref:`header_mutation filter  <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.header_mutation.v3.HeaderMutation>` to remove
 * the ORCA payload from the response headers/trailers.
 *
 * See the :ref:`load balancing architecture
 * overview<arch_overview_load_balancing_types>` for more information.
