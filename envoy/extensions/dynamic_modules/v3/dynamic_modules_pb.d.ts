/**
 * Configuration of a dynamic module. A dynamic module is a shared object file that can be loaded via dlopen
 * by various Envoy extension points. Currently, only HTTP filter (envoy.filters.http.dynamic_modules) is supported.
 *
 * How a module is loaded is determined by the extension point that uses it. For example, the HTTP filter
 * loads the module with dlopen when Envoy receives a configuration that references the module at load time.
 * If loading the module fails, the configuration will be rejected.
 *
 * Whether or not the shared object is the same is determined by the file path as well as the file's inode depending
 * on the platform. Notably, if the file path and the content of the file are the same, the shared object will be reused.
 *
 * A module must be compatible with the ABI specified in :repo:`abi.h <source/extensions/dynamic_modules/abi.h>`.
 * Currently, compatibility is only guaranteed by an exact version match between the Envoy
 * codebase and the dynamic module SDKs. In the future, after the ABI is stabilized, we will revisit
 * this restriction and hopefully provide a wider compatibility guarantee. Until then, Envoy
 * checks the hash of the ABI header files to ensure that the dynamic modules are built against the
 * same version of the ABI.
