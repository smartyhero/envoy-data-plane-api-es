 * effective visibility for multiple labels is the union of each label's
 * elements, plus any unrestricted elements.
 *
 * If an element and its parents have no restrictions, visibility is
 * unconditionally granted.

 *       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.EnhancedSearch
 *         restriction: PREVIEW
 *       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Delegate
