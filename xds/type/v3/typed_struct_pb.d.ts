/**
 * A TypedStruct contains an arbitrary JSON serialized protocol buffer message with a URL that
 * describes the type of the serialized message. This is very similar to google.protobuf.Any,
 * instead of having protocol buffer binary, this employs google.protobuf.Struct as value.
 *
 * This message is intended to be embedded inside Any, so it shouldn't be directly referred
 * from other UDPA messages.
 *
 * When packing an opaque extension config, packing the expected type into Any is preferred
 * wherever possible for its efficiency. TypedStruct should be used only if a proto descriptor
 * is not available, for example if:
 *
 * - A control plane sends opaque message that is originally from external source in human readable
 *   format such as JSON or YAML.
 * - The control plane doesn't have the knowledge of the protocol buffer schema hence it cannot
 *   serialize the message in protocol buffer binary format.
 * - The DPLB doesn't have have the knowledge of the protocol buffer schema its plugin or extension
 *   uses. This has to be indicated in the DPLB capability negotiation.
 *
 * When a DPLB receives a TypedStruct in Any, it should:
 * - Check if the type_url of the TypedStruct matches the type the extension expects.
 * - Convert value to the type described in type_url and perform validation.
 *
 * TODO(lizan): Figure out how TypeStruct should be used with DPLB extensions that doesn't link
 * protobuf descriptor with DPLB itself, (e.g. gRPC LB Plugin, Envoy WASM extensions).
